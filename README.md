Pet Shop Application - handles a simple online catalogue of a pet shop.

Customers should be able to browse at the catalogue, look at individual animals and leave comments. 

## The application breaks down to:
•	Home page – welcome, two selected animals (most highly commented upon) <br/>
•	Catalogue Page – lists the animals by category (Mammal, Reptile, Aquatic) <br/>
•	Animal Page – shows an individual animal (name, age, picture, short description) as well as a list of comments. This page will also allow to add comments for the animal. <br/>
•	Admin page – allows to add / edit / remove an animal. <br/>
